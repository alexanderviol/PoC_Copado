#recommended to manage this outside git

#if you are not customizing a managed package, you can keep your repository clean by ignoring 

#all files for that package. For example, to ignore all files of the "Copado" managed package

#just add to your gitignore file the following text: *copado__*

#if you will be customizing managed packages, make sure that the same version of the package 

#is installed on all your environments so that deployments will only update existing 

#managed components. Creation of managed components is not permitted by the API.

#It is recommended that you ignore managed components that cannot be modified 

#since there is no need to track them in Git, like for example:



#classes/copado__*

#triggers/copado__*

pages/copado__*



#Translations are com
